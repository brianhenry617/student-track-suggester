          <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
            Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 122,000 stars.[2]</p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React">Back End</a></p>
          <p>In computing, React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[2] for building user interfaces.
            It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.[3][4][5]
            React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. React processes only user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS.[6]</p>
